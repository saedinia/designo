## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The Name, Email Address, or Your Message fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The Email Address is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- View actual locations on the locations page maps
- See visible focus states for interactive elements when navigating by keyboard
- Understand and be able to navigate page content while using assistive technology
- Access the website without JavaScript
