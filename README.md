# Documentation

This is the place where I put all the resources that I find useful to build this project. This can be used for future reference or help anyone that is doing this challenge.

## Notes

It is worth knowing that `bg-pattern-design-pages-intro-tablet.svg` is the same background pattern as `bg-pattern-intro-web.svg`. The site uses the `bg-pattern-intro-web.svg` as the main background pattern for the web design card while using the other one as the default background pattern of the card (`.champion__card`).

The screenshots are not the representing the actual look of the site. So, see the website to know the look of the site.

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The Name, Email Address, or Your Message fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The Email Address is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- View actual locations on the locations page maps
- See visible focus states for interactive elements when navigating by keyboard
- Understand and be able to navigate page content while using assistive technology
- Access the website without JavaScript

## Web Documentation

- [`<footer>` - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN #accessibility_concerns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer#accessibility_concerns) - Prior to the release of Safari 13, the `contentinfo` [landmark role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics#signpostslandmarks) was not properly exposed by [VoiceOver](https://help.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/). If needing to support legacy Safari browsers, add `role="contentinfo"` to the footer element to ensure the landmark will be properly exposed.
- [HTML Standard #the-address-element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-address-element) - The `address` element must not be used to represent arbitrary addresses (e.g. postal addresses), unless those addresses are in fact the relevant contact information. (The `p` element is the appropriate element for marking up postal addresses in general.)
- [HTMLElement.inert - Web APIs | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/inert) - The [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) property `inert` is a boolean value that, when present, makes the browser "ignore" user input events for the element, including focus events and events from assistive technologies.
- [HTML Standard #the-inert-attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#the-inert-attribute)
- [Attribute selectors - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)
- [General sibling combinator - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator)
- [Window.matchMedia() - Web APIs | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)
- [CSS API update  |  Google Fonts  |  Google Developers #optimizing_your_font_requests](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2#optimizing_your_font_requests) - Use the `text=` to get necessary bold font.
- [`<picture>`: The Picture element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture)
- [`:nth-of-type()` - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type) - I used this to make the first `.information` has no `margin-top` on mobile breakpoint.

- [Contextually Marking up accessible images and SVGs](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/05/22/contextual-images-svgs-and-a11y.html)
  - Prior to macOS 10.14.4, `aria-hidden="true"` would also be necessary to completely hide a decorative image to VoiceOver when paired with Chrome. Without the ARIA attribute, VoiceOver would still focus the image, but provide no announcement.
  - A SVG that does not add important information to a document should be considered decorative. The following markup pattern uses `aria-hidden="true"` to hide the SVG from screen readers. `focusable="false"` is also used to ensure Internet Explorer won’t allow the Tab key to navigate into the SVG.

- [Build a fully-responsive, progressively enhanced burger menu - Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/)
  - We remove focus styles from the `<main>` element because when someone activates the skip link from before, it programatically focuses the `<main>` because it’s the `:target`. The focus ring is unnecessary though, because making the `<main>` focusable, programatically, is purely for making tabbing on the keyboard more predictable for users who want to skip navigation. If we didn’t move focus, they could end up in a situation where hitting the tab key sends them back up the the navigation!
  - What’s handy with this approach is that using `tabindex="-1"` prevents the user from being able to tab to the element with their keyboard too, so it’s really helpful with focus management of interactive elements, which we’ll get on to later in this tutorial.
- [Landmark Regions | APG | WAI | W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/landmark-regions/) - If a specific landmark role is used more than once on a page, provide each instance of that landmark with a unique label.

- ["Fixing" Lists | scottohara.me](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html) - As [Adrian Roselli notes on Twitter](https://twitter.com/aardrian/status/1083889915417559040) a lack of list semantics “…may not be a big deal unless user testing says you really need a list.”
